If there’s a specific example, I’d like to see it, just so there’s no confusion. After all, I don’t believe that comparison was made in this thread specifically.\n\nAlso, this is a sales forum. If we’re not discussing the sales of different titles, then what are we here for?Even if one title is expected to vastly or obviously outsell another, it doesn’t mean there’s no merit in comparing and/or contrasting them. In my opinion, no titles should have any special considerations one way or the other.\n\nIt seems to me like a preemptive effort to prevent something that hasn’t really occurred much if at all. It’s also interesting to hear about it like it’s some new policy that’s just to be accepted, when I’ve personally only seen two moderators bring it up, seemingly in tandem.\n\nI don’t know. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells when it comes to comparing certain titles and I don’t entirely understand the rhyme or reason behind a “need” or a prerequisite that compared titles must be very similar. Will there start being repercussions for comparing certain pairs of titles in certain ways? Shouldn’t heated disputes be handled on a case by case basis after receiving reports? Is this something that we should vote on?",

      "message": "[QUOTE=\"Tokuiten, post: 139695, member: 625\"]\nIt's good then that I've been using the word \"unprofessional\" in the way it means something. The FTC has been unprofessional by acting on ideology over actually protecting consumers, going as far as declaring Nintendo its own, different market to keep their argument alive. After the auspicious contracts with Nintendo and Nvidia, it would look even more like the FTC values Sony's well-being over people. Sony's unprofessionalism is in how they intentionally warp reality to make the deal look bad, contradicting themselves (saying CoD is important for PS's survival at some point, downplaying its importance at another time when it better suits their argument) and going as far as calling Nintendo \"for children\", something one wouldn't have expected to hear in the year 2022/23 again.\n\nIf you want to call that \"doing their job\", that's your prerogative, but I will keep calling it unprofessional, because there are facts and if everyone abided by these facts and the associated laws, then there would be no back and forth, it could be a clean decision. Doing what the FTC and Sony have been doing has muddied due process and here were are. It's bad for everyone.\n\nYou're comparing apples to pears.\n\nWhat did Nintendo get from Bethesda? Singular entrances in franchises that release in gaps of 10+ years? Meanwhile CoD is a yearly franchise with an active, ongoing community. Even ignoring that removing CoD from other platforms would just make MS lose a ton of money, it'd cause negative PR all over the industry. And as others mentioned, 10 years is such a long time, so much can change by then. People need to stop trying to find a way to paint MS as an evil company that's trying to fool everyone for reasons.\n[/QUOTE]\nSo then are MS/ABK the ones being \"professional\"?",

Feel free to correct me if I'm doing so.\n\nI understand you have your personal issues with moderation, issues that I don't know about the specifics (and quite honestly, nor have any interest in knowing), however, your constant need to throw shades at any misstep/hardship that the moderation team have to face feels not only extremely childish, but inconsiderate to the users involved and/or affected in/by the current discussion. If you are uncomfortable with the Staff (or any other member) views, you can voice your concerns without the need of using unrelated matters as a shield.\n\nThe Dragon Quest 12 platforms thread (which is more than 1 year old already) would resolve around arguments without solid base [B][U]AND[/U] [/B]would likely end up heated discussion (as proven sporadically every time Dragon Quest 12 is brought up on Media Create thread), no one was prohibited of arguing in favor of said thread and I'm yet to see someone being banned for discussing Dragon Quest 12 platforms (and future). The thread was banned because it was a combination of \"Not exactly fit for Install Base scope\" + \"Controvery Lightning Rod\". Of course, if you want to paint a bad image to the Moderation Team, it is very interesting to look at this situation as a snapshot, but the true is that 15 days later Tokuiten themselves made a thread/poll called \"[URL='https://www.installbaseforum.com/forums/threads/which-one-will-release-first-metroid-prime-4-or-metroid-prime-1-remake.592/']Which one will release first: Metroid Prime 4 or Metroid Prime 1 Remake[/URL]\", which just like the previous one was not directly tied to the forum scope (also far less controversial) but got no sanctions from the moderation at all and I assume that Tokuiten feedback, about being uncomfortable with the treatment that their previous thread got, had some influence on the way Staff handled future threads and general posts.\n[/QUOTE]\n\nThe first sentence is the age old questions, 'how free do you want your speech?' and 'what did they really mean by that?'.\n\nBy letting the conversation about the game happen at all someone gifted with words can dog-whistle the shit out of any piece of news and avoid blame every time they are suspected or confronted.\n\nThe mods know it's risky but gave people guidelines on how to proceed.\n\nI'm actually not even criticizing the handling of this issue in particular.\n\n\n\nNow as far as you bringing my \"personal issues with moderation\" I don't really feel the need to defend myself since, as you correctly stated, you don't know the half of it. My default is not to always rage against the machine. They can and in the past have done better and I still think some still can. I provide feedback in my own style. It won't please everyone and I do not need validation. Nor do I need to latch onto any subject like an opportunistic parasite to make a point. I'm rather offended by suggestion actually.",

So saying this merger benefits consumers is not true.\n\nThe cloud argument is very weak as well because the majority of core gamers currently have little to no interest in playing games like Starfield or Diablo 4 on the cloud. Starfield isn't going to suddenly have 100 million players because it's available to play on mobile devices.\n[/QUOTE]\nIt benefits some consumers more than others, a popular game on more platforms may be worth more than a less popular game on more platforms.  I get that you are upset about the merger, but if CoD is as important as being claimed, the lack of Blizzard games being made available is a small price to pay.  Besides, you could just buy an Xbox if you wanted to play those.",

The $499 SKU is a unicorn that is seen briefly. On Amazon, that model gets so little supply each drop that it was always consistently around the 80's placement, a significant decrease from what was available last year.

Problem solved, everyone gets what they want.\n[/QUOTE]\nNo, you'd ruin a successful formula to appease a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a vocal minority that only exists on video game forums.\n\nBreath of the Wild's gameplay is a carefully balanced system.  A perfect example is weapon degradation.  If you got rid of it, players would just keep one weapon and there wouldn't be any real sense of survival or preserving and consuming resources.  Weapons are meant to be transient resources like food or ammo that and are to be managed as such.\n\nIf you put in locks and keys, those keys would not be able to degrade and be consumed.  They'd become a plot MacGuffin and detract from the player making his or her own adventure.  They'd become things you need to get rather than a resource you manage to tame a hostile world.\n\nYou can't go back.  If you go back a little bit, you make the game linear.  If you make it linear, you burn the 20+ million new fans (and old fans like me where were sick of the linearity) you made with the open air gameplay.",

CMA doesn’t give one fig about the EC, but FTC and CMA are going to pressure EC to conform to their ways?  Funny how EC apparently isn’t allowed to have a will of its own, yet the FTC and CMA can apparently operate irrespective of other regulators and feel no reciprocal pressure.\n[/QUOTE]\nIt's kind of amusing to see how the irrationally anti-merger people continue to view the facts from an insanely warped perspective. You can go back to earlier in this thread and find posts about how the FTC/CMA/EU would be in lock step on this. Now that we know not only is the EU likely to approve, all signs point to them approving with minimal concessions from Microsoft, suddenly the EU is going to be pressured to get back in line with the CMA and FTC. This is despite all other regulators, all legal experts, and virtually all participants in the market saying the CMA/FTC's case is laughably bad and this is only interesting because of how the CMA is currently structured in terms of appeals.",
